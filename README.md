# React.js Simple Pokedex

## My first React.js web application

This is my very first web application built right after learning the basics of **React.js**. It’s a simple Pokédex that fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays a list of Pokémon with their main details.

I built this app using React.js with its core hooks, keeping things clean and simple. To bring the interface to life, I added a touch of Framer Motion for smooth animations—making it feel more dynamic than a plain static page.

Currently, the app displays basic Pokémon info including name, generation, types, weight, height, and a short description. Evolution data isn’t included yet, but it’s definitely on my roadmap!
